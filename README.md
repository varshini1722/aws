# Project: Deploy a Scalable Web Application on AWS

**Project Overview:**
You will deploy a simple web application using AWS services. The application will be hosted on Amazon EC2, with data stored in Amazon RDS, and you'll use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Auto Scaling to ensure scalability and high availability.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up an AWS Account:**
   - Create an AWS account if you don’t have one.
   - Set up IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles and policies for security.

2. **Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**
   - **VPC Setup:** Create a VPC with public and private subnets.
   - **Internet Gateway:** Attach an Internet Gateway to your VPC for internet access.

3. **Launch an EC2 Instance:**
   - **Select AMI:** Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) such as Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu.
   - **Instance Type:** Select an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for testing).
   - **Configure Security Groups:** Set up inbound rules to allow HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) access.

4. **Deploy the Web Application:**
   - **Application Code:** Deploy a sample web application (e.g., a simple Flask or Node.js app).
   - **Install Dependencies:** Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH and install necessary software (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or Node.js).

5. **Set Up a Database with Amazon RDS:**
   - **Create an RDS Instance:** Launch an RDS instance using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or another supported database engine.
   - **Configure Security Groups:** Allow your EC2 instance to connect to your RDS instance.

6. **Configure Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):**
   - **Create an ELB:** Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB).
   - **Register EC2 Instances:** Add your EC2 instance(s) to the load balancer.

7. **Set Up Auto Scaling:**
   - **Create an Auto Scaling Group:** Define the scaling policies based on CPU utilization or other metrics.
   - **Launch Configuration:** Configure instance settings and AMI for Auto Scaling.

8. **Implement Monitoring and Logging:**
   - **CloudWatch:** Set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor the performance of your EC2 instances and RDS database.
   - **Logs:** Use CloudWatch Logs to collect and analyze application logs.

9. **Secure Your Application:**
   - **IAM Roles:** Ensure your EC2 instance has the appropriate IAM role for accessing other AWS services securely.
   - **Security Groups:** Review and refine security group rules to follow the principle of least privilege.

10. **Test and Optimize:**
    - **Load Testing:** Perform load testing to ensure your application can handle traffic.
    - **Cost Management:** Monitor AWS costs using the Cost Explorer and set up budgets if needed.

#### Optional Enhancements

- **Use Amazon S3:** For storing static assets such as images or files.
- **Implement a CI/CD Pipeline:** Use AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy for automated deployment.
- **Add CloudFront:** Integrate Amazon CloudFront for Content Delivery Network (CDN) capabilities to improve performance.

### Summary

This project involves deploying a scalable web application using a combination of AWS services including EC2, RDS, ELB, and Auto Scaling. It covers fundamental aspects of cloud infrastructure, including setting up a VPC, managing security, and implementing scaling solutions. By completing this project, you’ll gain valuable experience in AWS cloud architecture and deployment best practices.
